#
# Create a class called Student that has the following attributes:
#  name, email, github, cohort, start_date, and current_project.
#
# The constructor should accept all of these parameters as arguments, and
# assign each one to the appropriate attribute.
#
# The Student class should have the following methods:
#  get_name_and_email() - returns a string containing the student's full name
#   and email address
#  get_github_username() - returns a string containing just the student's
#   github username
#  change_email(new_address) - change the student's email address to the new
#   address
#  is_active_student() - returns True if the student start_date is less than 60 datys from now.
# get_tutor() - returns the student's current tutor. If the student is not assigned, return None.

# Create a class called Tutor that has the following attributes:
#  name, email, github, calednar_link, and current_project.

#   github username
#  change_email(new_address) - change the tutor's email address to the new

#  assign_student(student) - assign the given student to the tutors `students` list.

# Add a method to to the Student class called get_tutor_email that returns
# the email address of the student's tutor. If they do not have a tutor assigned, it should return "No tutor assigned".

# Bonus: Refactor the two classes above into a single class called User.
# The User class should have the following attributes:
#  name, email, github, calednar_link, and current_project.
